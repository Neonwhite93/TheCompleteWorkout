Pros/Wins
In person meeting consistently. Wednesday lab meeitings have been very helpful. constent emails for important items has been helpful instead of putting them on Hipchat. hipchat is great for quick communication and chatching up on each other. 

Cons/fails
Getting more group members in with client during each sprint. Time. A clear understanding of what each individual needs to do.
