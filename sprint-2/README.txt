Work in this sprint included frontend work and database content. 

front-end content can be launched from release/frontend_simple/index.html

	-- Please note Halie's awesome Python script:
		release/frontend_simple/exercises/createExerciseWebpage.py
	   which helped in automated creation of exercise pages...

Database content can be viewed in release/database_wip folder -- but will not yet
	appear in front end html content

Note that we spent a lot of this sprint experimenting with different color schemes,
as per the client's request -- those can be viewed in WIP/color_tests in
the corresponding index.html files
