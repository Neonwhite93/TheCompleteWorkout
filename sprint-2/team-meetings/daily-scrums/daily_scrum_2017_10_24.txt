Donovan

1) I have added more descriptions to the exercises and continue to search for how to set up the site with the db
2) I would like to finish both descriptions and connecting db before next meeting
3) DB is the current roadblock, if anyone can findout how to get it connected that would be awesome.

Dustin
1) I've done more page forming for all of the different screens of the login / admin areas.
2) I think the next logical step is to try and hammer out getting the PHP session to work with the server
3) Road block is going to figure out how to connect and also how to discern the admin from users when logging in with PHP

Nate
1) Since last meeting I've gone through index.html and made a version w/o thumnails or description text. 
2) Before next meeting I'd like to have the index/exercise pages content better automated with php. Even without DB connectivity there's stuff we 
   could do there which would make generating the accordions easier, and making visual changes less tedious. Right now that's a pain.
3) No obvious roadblocks right now. Although I'd like to get the DB connection stuff running soon for full automation.

Halie
1) Resolved issues re: exercise videos -- now everyone can access video controls. Investigated ways to make the video expand to full-screen on one click.
2) Currently working on removing green boxes from the main menu accordions.
3) Roadblock -- internet troubles at home
