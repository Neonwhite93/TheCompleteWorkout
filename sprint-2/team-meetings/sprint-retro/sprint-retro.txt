Client status: satisfied, but perhaps not satsified with colors
	-- some confusion as to whether we should be following our own designs
		or using designs created by designer Sam, who is working with SRC

What worked:
In person meeting consistently. Wednesday lab meeitings have been very helpful. constent emails for important items has been helpful instead of putting them on Hipchat. hipchat is great for quick communication and chatching up on each other. 

Needs work:
etting more group members in with client during each sprint. Time. A clear understanding of what each individual needs to do.  


Brainstorming: 
review Plans for sprint 3
