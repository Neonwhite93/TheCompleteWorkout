Client meetings in person, and by proxy with Kris Anderson at planning meeting --

Client seems most concerned with getting SOMETHING working.
Some variation in priortities between clients Ben and Drew.

-- Ben wants something simple running, digital equivalent of whiteboard used in class.
-- Drew/Kris more focused on long-term potential.

[NOTE -- if we have any email transactions with client during this period, here would be a good place
for cp]
