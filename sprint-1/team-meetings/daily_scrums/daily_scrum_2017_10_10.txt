Donovan
1) since last meeting I have added the mysql version of foreign keys
2) I want to get some insert statements in for testing and start using the db on the webapp
3) No roadblocks atm

Dustin
1) So I've been working on the request system for students to request access accounts
2) I'm going to continue to try and hone the PHP used in it
3) Currently the hiccup is re-learning PHP and will eventually need to adapt it to actually work with the eventual database.

Nate
1) Since the last meeting I've gone through and added placeholder videos for all of the exercises in our Excel sheet. There's at least something (8+) exercises in each category now.
2) What I'd like to do next is work with cookies to achieve seamless transitions between the exercise pages and the index page. I want it to remember which accordion you had open, and where you were in the scroll-bar.
3) No roadblocks right now.

Halie
1) I got the two groups of exercises webpages created.
2) I'm researching ways to keep the accordion open to the exercise the user chose.
3) No internet thanks to fire.
