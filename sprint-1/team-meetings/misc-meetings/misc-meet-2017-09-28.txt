Topics discussed today:
  Today was a Daily Scrum;
  Donovan Miller:
  [7:34 PM] dsm425: I am currently working on practicing getting our tables into my personal phpmyadmin, because I am unable to get into thecompleteworks. I want to finish the database and help get the database connected to the site.
  [7:34 PM] dsm425: Roadblock again accessing phpmyadmin for thecompleteworkout
  Resolve roadblock: If I finish my errands tomorrow at a reasonable time Ill go the the gym then or I will have to go in tuesday morning.

  Dustin Boyd:
   So, not much as changed. I've not gotten much done on my side, alas I've been focusing more on my assignments. I'm wanting to move forward with coding a admin portal, but before I get too heavy in it I would like to see @HalieCarton & @NateSpence code so I can mimic the same style. 
   Still working out the kinks to get connected to our github

  Halie Carton:
    I just got home not too long ago. I haven't done too much for the project, but the Python script for creating the exercise pages is on the my app GitHub. I'll see if I can bust out a bunch of exercise pages this weekend.

  Nate Spence:
    Unable to join us this time due to his Thesis.
