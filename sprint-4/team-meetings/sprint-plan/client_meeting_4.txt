Hello Drew, 
The CS 458 team would like to meet with you about the current state of the app. What is a time that would work for you to meet? About a half hour would be a good amount of time for us. 
This Thursday 11/02/2017 at 10:30 AM would work for us, but let me know what would be a good time for you.

Thank you
