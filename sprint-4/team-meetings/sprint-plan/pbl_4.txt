New user stories for Sprint 4:

	* Students can visit MyWorkout page, add exercises, sets and reps 
          <--- eventually subtraction will be allowed too

Leftover user stories for Sprint 3:


As a developer
I would like to utilize the database to determine whether a user is an administrator or student
So that I can direct them to the appropriate page.
Estimated time: 10 hours
Acceptance criteria:
	* At time of log in users will be directed to admin or regular content 
          depending on their account credentials
Priority: 2

As a user
I would like the app to remember the accordion I was in
So that I can resume where I left off after viewing a video
Estimated time: 8 hours
Acceptance criteria:
	* After viewing video when you return to the main page the accordion
	  you last used is still open.
	* AND, with above, the accordion scroll-bar should be focused

As an instructor
I would like to add exercises to the database from a GUI
So that I can easily make changes to the exercise list myself (rather than requiring technical assistance)
Estimated time: 10 hours
Acceptance criteria: ---------------------- NOTE: this will probably be subdivided into multiple user-stories before being tackled
	* Instructor can log in to admin screen
	* Instructor can use drop-downs and fields to add/remove/edit DB content

As a user 
I would like to add exercises to a playlist 
So that I can plan/track my exercises/workouts

						      playlists may be added later as a separate idea...
Acceptance criteria:

	* I can access and progress through my playlist later
