I have cloned your RepoMan repository and looked over your proposal-bid.pdf.

You project proposal is accepted. Be sure that you follow the project
handout guidelines starting at this point as you continue with your project.

One note: you were asked to make a subdirectory:

proposal

...and put proposal-bid.pdf into that subdirectory; you had it on
the top-level instead. I have corrected this so that I can put these 
comments into your proposal directory along with your proposal bid.
