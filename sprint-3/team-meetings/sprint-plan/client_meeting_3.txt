Client meetings in person, and by proxy with Kris Anderson at planning meeting --

Client seems generally happy with progress
More talk of tracking exercises, allowing users to create playlists/custom work-outs
Seems understanding of slow pace -- seems positive about graphic designs -- prefers simple designs to complex
Some difficulty with universally positive feedback making forward direction less clear

[NOTE -- if we have any email transactions with client during this period, here would be a good place
for cp]
